= .NET Modular Monolith Starter
:toc: macro

A production-ready starter template for building modular monolith applications using .NET 9.0, implementing the Backend-For-Frontend (BFF) pattern with Keycloak authentication. If you're not familiar with the modular monolith concept, you can find an explanation for this choice in the https://github.com/evolutionary-architecture/evolutionary-architecture-by-example/blob/main/README.md#-modular-monolith[Evolutionary Architecture's documentation].

== Features

=== üèóÔ∏è Modular Monolith Architecture
* Clean separation of concerns
* Module-based structure
* Easy to extend and maintain

=== üîê Authentication & Authorization
* BFF (Backend-For-Frontend) pattern implementation
* Keycloak integration

=== üöå Event-Driven Architecture
* Transactional Outbox Pattern implementation
* Message-driven communication between modules

=== üìä Observability
* OpenTelemetry integration
* Grafana dashboards
* Jaeger for tracing
* Prometheus metrics

=== üß™ Testing
* Unit testing setup with xUnit
* Integration testing with TestContainers

== Prerequisites

* .NET SDK 9.0
* Docker

== Getting Started

=== 1. Clone the repository

=== 2. Navigate to the source directory
[source,bash]
----
cd src
----

=== 3. Build the Docker images
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose build
----

=== 4. Start the application
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
For local development with Docker Compose, additional setup is required to handle Keycloak authentication properly. Please refer to the link:LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.adoc[Local Development Guide] for detailed instructions.
====

The application will be available at:

* BFF: http://localhost:8081
* API: http://localhost:8080
* Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html

== Project Structure

[source]
----
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Starter/              # Main API application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Starter.BFF/          # Backend-For-Frontend application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Starter.Common/       # Shared libraries and utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Starter.UnitTests/    # Unit tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Starter.IntegrationTests/ # Integration tests

== Authentication Flow

The project uses Keycloak as the identity provider with the BFF pattern:

. Frontend applications communicate with the BFF
. BFF handles authentication with Keycloak
. BFF proxies authenticated requests to the main API
. API validates JWT tokens and handles authorization

=== Direct API Access

If you need to bypass the BFF and access the APIs directly, you can obtain an access token from Keycloak using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
curl --location 'http://localhost:7002/realms/starter-realm/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=password' \
--data-urlencode 'username={your username}' \
--data-urlencode 'password={your password}' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=starter-client' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=yNSMFyKxVUsL5g0xASiGXYs7RkZPQJ2h'
----

The response will contain an access token that can be used to authenticate direct API calls by including it in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

== Running Tests

=== Unit Tests
[source,bash]
----
dotnet test src/Starter.UnitTests
----

=== Integration Tests
[source,bash]
----
dotnet test src/Starter.IntegrationTests
----

[NOTE]
====
Integration tests require Docker to be running as they use TestContainers.

= .NET Modular Monolith Starter
:toc: macro

A production-ready starter template for building modular monolith applications using .NET 9.0, implementing the Backend-For-Frontend (BFF) pattern with Keycloak authentication.

== Features

=== 🏗️ Modular Monolith Architecture
* Clean separation of concerns
* Module-based structure
* Easy to extend and maintain

=== 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
* BFF (Backend-For-Frontend) pattern implementation
* Keycloak integration

=== 🚌 Event-Driven Architecture
* Transactional Outbox Pattern implementation
* Message-driven communication between modules

=== 📊 Observability
* OpenTelemetry integration
* Grafana dashboards
* Jaeger for tracing
* Prometheus metrics

=== 🧪 Testing
* Unit testing setup with xUnit
* Integration testing with TestContainers

== Prerequisites

* .NET SDK 9.0
* Docker

== Getting Started

=== 1. Clone the repository

=== 2. Navigate to the source directory
[source,bash]
----
cd src
----

=== 3. Build the Docker images
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose build
----

=== 4. Start the application
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

The application will be available at:

* BFF: http://localhost:8081
* API: http://localhost:8080
* Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html

== Authentication Flow

The project uses Keycloak as the identity provider with the BFF pattern:

. Frontend applications communicate with the BFF
. BFF handles authentication with Keycloak
. BFF proxies authenticated requests to the main API
. API validates JWT tokens and handles authorization

== Running Tests

=== Unit Tests
[source,bash]
----
dotnet test src/Starter.UnitTests
----

=== Integration Tests
[source,bash]
----
dotnet test src/Starter.IntegrationTests
----

[NOTE]
====
Integration tests require Docker to be running as they use TestContainers.

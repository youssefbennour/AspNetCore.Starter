# Use Transactional Outbox Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In our application, we communicate between modules through events. This is the approach we have chosen for maintaining a decoupled system, allowing modules to evolve independently. However, it is crucial for our business that we do not have inconsistent states across different modules.

To illustrate the potential for state inconsistencies, consider the following scenarios:

1. **Event Handling Failure After Transaction Commitment**: If a transaction is committed successfully and the corresponding event is then published, there is a risk that the event handler may fail to process the event. This could occur due to various reasons, such as temporary unavailability of the service handling the event or an unexpected error in the event processing logic. As a result, the state in the module that published the event would be consistent, while the state in the module that was supposed to handle the event may remain inconsistent.

2. **Transaction Failure After Event Publication**: Conversely, if an event is published before the transaction is committed, there is a risk that even if the event is handled successfully, the transaction could still fail. For instance, if the event triggers a series of operations that depend on the successful completion of the original transaction, any failure in the transaction would lead to an inconsistent state across modules. This scenario highlights the importance of ensuring that events are only published when the corresponding operations have been successfully committed.

## Decision
We have decided to implement the transactional outbox pattern to ensure that events/messages are delivered at least once. This pattern is implemented by saving events in the database within the same transaction as their corresponding operations.

The `OutboxProcessor` class will be responsible for processing these events, ensuring they are dispatched to the appropriate event bus for further handling.

Additionally, each module should have its own worker for processing events because each module operates within a separate `DbContext`. This design ensures that event handling is isolated and does not interfere with other modules. 

Furthermore, each module that utilizes the transactional outbox pattern must implement its own interfaces and implementations of the event bus. This is essential as each module needs to pass the corresponding `DbContext` to the event bus. For instance, the `IEventBus` and its persistent implementation in `PersistentEventBus` serve as examples. Similarly, the interfaces for event buses in `IContractsEventBus` and `PersistentContractsEventBus` illustrate the necessary abstractions for implementing this pattern across modules.

The use of the transactional outbox pattern in any module is optional and can be configured using Dependency Injection (DI). This flexibility allows for different modules to choose whether to use the outbox pattern, depending on their specific needs.

## Consequences

1. **Code complexity**: One of the key consequences of adopting the transactional outbox pattern is that each module should have its own worker for processing events. This is necessary because each module operates within its own logically separate database. This separation allows for independent processing of events while ensuring that the overall system remains consistent.

2. **Reliability in Event Delivery**: The pattern ensures that events are reliably delivered, which is critical for maintaining data integrity across modules. This reliability is essential for business operations that depend on accurate and timely data.

3. **Operational Overhead**: While the outbox pattern improves consistency, it introduces some operational overhead. This includes the need for monitoring the outbox and ensuring that events are processed correctly, which may require additional tooling or infrastructure.

4. **Potential for Event Duplication**: Although the pattern guarantees at least once delivery, there is a risk of event duplication. This necessitates careful design in the event handlers to ensure that duplicate events do not lead to inconsistent states.
One solution to this problem is to implement the idempotent consumer pattern.

By considering these consequences, we can better prepare for the implementation and ongoing management of the transactional outbox pattern in our application.

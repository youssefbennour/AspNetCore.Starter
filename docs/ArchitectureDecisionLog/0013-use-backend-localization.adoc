# 1. Use exceptions for validations

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Users from different nationalitites should be able to interact with our system, for this purpose implementing multilingual support is crucial.

We have thought of 2 options:

1 - implement localization in the back-end.

2 - implement localization in the front-end.

## Decision

After considering our current situation, and since we currently have a shortage of front-end developers, we decided to delegate the process of localization to the back-end.

## Consequences

- Users from differente nationalities and differenet mother tongues, will be able to easily interact with our APIs, SPAs...

- Since our API reponses and error messages by default originate from the back-end, back-end developers, are the most knowledgeable of what the back-end is responding with, thus we win the time front-end developers would have spent navigating through hundreds of responses and error messages.

- We should expect some latency in our API respons times, since localization/translation is happening in the back-end.

# 1. Use exceptions for validations

Date: 2024-04-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Users worldwide should be able to easily interact with our applications, for this purpose a localization mechanism has to be implemented

We have thought of 2 options:

- Server-side localization

- Client-side localization.

## Decision

After considering our current situation, and since we currently have a shortage of front-end developers, we decided to delegate the process of localization to the back-end.

## Consequences

- Users worldwide will be able to easily interact with our APIs, SPAs...

- We should expect some latency in our API respons times.
